# üß† AI-Powered Movie Recommendation Agent

This repository contains a prototype application that provides intelligent movie recommendations using a local AI agent. The project integrates a C# Windows Forms frontend with a Python Flask backend.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Natural Language Queries**: Users can enter questions or prompts through a Windows Forms UI.
* **AI Integration**: The backend forwards the question to a locally hosted language model via **Ollama** to generate movie recommendations.
* **API Communication**: Uses HTTP POST requests to communicate between the C# frontend and the Python API.
* **Persistent Storage**: All user queries and AI-generated responses are stored in a local database using **SQLAlchemy**.
* **Storage Limit**: The application enforces a fixed limit on the number of stored entries (hardcoded in this version).
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extendable to include features such as authentication, dynamic limits, and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: C# (.NET Windows Forms)
* **Backend**: Python with Flask
* **Database**: SQLite managed with SQLAlchemy
* **AI Engine**: Local LLM powered by **Ollama**
